    <section class="about-me" id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Kavya, and I'm passionate about technology and its intersection with biology. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Biosciences at Arizona State University, where I also hold a Certificate in Symbolic, Linguistic, and Cognitive Systems. My technical skills include Java, C, C++, HTML, MATLAB, Bash, Linux, SQL, JavaFX, Arduino, Assembly, and Microsoft 365.</p>
        <p>I was a Research Scholar in the Biocomputing Scholars Program since January 2022. I worked on a project called PREP, which enhanced automated software repair in C to improve performance across multiple repair tools and datasets.</p>
        <p>In terms of projects, I've developed a personal Valentines website that prompts users to accept a Valentine request with a dynamic "no" button that moves and displays cat images until "yes" is selected. For my CSE 240 Final Project, I created an algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. In my CSE 120 Capstone project, I designed a custom circuit simulating an island scenario with residents and visitors crossing a bridge under set constraints, and I built an autonomous miniature car programmed to navigate a maze for my FSE 100 project.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities. As a Scholar in the Grand Challenges Scholars Program, I engage in research, interdisciplinary coursework, service events, and entrepreneurship. I am also an active member of Theta Tau, a professional engineering fraternity, where I serve as a New Member Educator and contribute to the Professionalism Committee. Additionally, I participate in Combat Robotics, building a combat robot for semester showcases, and I am a member of NeuroDevils, where I learn about research in neuroscience and cognitive science.</p>

    <section id="goals">
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My primary goal is to pursue a career in biocomputing or computational neuroscience. I am deeply interested in how technology can enhance our understanding of biological systems and improve healthcare solutions. I aim to leverage my skills in computer science to create innovative tools and applications that can assist in diagnosing and treating diseases, ultimately contributing to advancements in personalized medicine.</p>
        <p>In the short term, I plan to engage in internships and research opportunities that will allow me to apply my technical skills in real-world scenarios. </p>
        <p>Long-term, I aspire to pursue a graduate degree in computational neuroscience, where I can further my knowledge and research in neural networks and artificial intelligence. </p>
